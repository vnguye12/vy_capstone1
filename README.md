Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are businesses that have revenues, assets and a number of employees below a certain threshold. Although the definition of SMEs is different from country to country, their important role in the economy is undeniable. They are one of the strongest drivers of economic development, innovation and employment. The access to finance is recognized as the greatest obstacle to the growth of SMEs. The financing gap for SMEs is huge. Millions of SMEs have unmet financing needs all over the world. Lenders who can address this matter have great growing potential. The challenge for these lenders is how to manage loan risk efficiently and make accurate decisions. There are two basic risks here: one is a business loss results from not lending the good candidates, and the other is the financial loss for lending the candidates at bad risk. Therefore, the ability to recognize good candidates who are able to make payments is crucial.
